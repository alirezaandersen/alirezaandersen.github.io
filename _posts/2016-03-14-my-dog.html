<strong>Loyal to the very end <br>
Always wants to be your bestfriend<br>
Never want you to be alone<br>
Will even give you my last bone <br>
First one to greet you when you come home <br>
Always sad when I see you go<br>
Always glad for you to be around<br>
When your gone I have a little meltdown<br>
Howling cause I miss you<br>
I didn't mean to chew your shoes<br>
Even when I get caught I know<br>
You can't stay mad at me for much to long<br>
I'm sorry I did something wrong<br>
I'll always be by your side<br>
Everyday until I die<br>
Loyal to the very end <br>
Because you and I will always be bestfriends</strong><h3><br></p></div>
