<h1>WHO AM I NOT</h1>

<h2> WHO AM I NOT?</h2>

<p>Learning something new, in which you have a lot of interested for , but lack any
  knowledge about is always a fun, frustrating and fearful feeling all at the same time.
  I decided to become a web developer after a tough few years of struggles within my
  previous industry. </p>

<p>I decided to attend Turing School of Software and Design!
  The school reputation of building developers with people that had absolutely  no
  programming experience. The most experience that I had was programming my car radio.
  I assumed that this school would be great! If they made people like me with such little
  experiences into junior developers by the end of the program, then this was for me.</p>

<p>To my surprise on the first day of school, I met people both in my cohort(this is what
  the student class is called) and  out.  A lot of people had little to no experience just
  like myself, but then I would guess a good 20% of the students attending had a ton of
  experience, from a good will-hunting student(this guy is super smart) to a actual
  rocket scientist, and people with computer science educational backgrounds. Was this
  truly the school that developed people with little to no skill into junior programmers?</p>

<p>Throughout the first module (schools version of semesters) I learned a great deal of code
  that I never knew. All of my projects scored in the top part of the class, yet I continuously
  struggled with myself confidence and felt that I wasn’t where I needed to be. Although I did
  great on all my assessments, the feeling of lost and lack of knowledge was still there.
  I decided to put in longer hours at home and calculated that I spend about 18 hours a day
  learning and breathing how to code. This strategy must work, if I work 3 times as hard as
  everyone else then I will learn more and become more successful at this.  Finals came around
  and I panic tremendously, feeling like I knew nothing, I choked on my final and failed miserably.
  Guess I truly am a failure. Later that night, depressed, worried, sadden and drunk I decided
  to retake my test again. To my surprise not only did I finish it, I got every question right
  and all of the extra questions! </p>

<p>That’s when I realize I have impostor syndrome also known as fraud syndrome a term coined in
  1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to
  high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a
  persistent fear of being exposed as "fraud".[1] Despite external evidence of their competence,
  those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds
  and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing,
  or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they
  believe themselves to be. </p>

<p>Once I understood what was going on with me, I have started
  to learn how to deal with it. Celebrating the little victories and taking to others who go
  through the same emotions that I do.  If you feel like you are struggling but everyone around
  you doesn’t think you are, your instructors or bosses praise your work, then you may have impostor
  syndrome. </p>
