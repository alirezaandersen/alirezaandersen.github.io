<h4><p> Welcome to my site! So a little about me on how I became the myth, the legend, the man,
  It all started in 1980 born in a revolution that we had to flee traveled to Italy
  From there we came to the USA were I've been raised. I grew up in California where I
    learned the values of Family and Friends who without them today I would not be the myth, the legend,
    the man. <br><br> Checkout the links above to get to know more about me. </p></h4>

<strong>Loyal to the very end <br>
Always wants to be your bestfriend<br>
Never want you to be alone<br>
Will even give you my last bone <br>
First one to greet you when you come home <br>
Always sad when I see you go<br>
Always glad for you to be around<br>
When your gone I have a little meltdown<br>
Howling cause I miss you<br>
I didn't mean to chew your shoes<br>
Even when I get caught I know<br>
You can't stay mad at me for much to long<br>
I'm sorry I did something wrong<br>
I'll always be by your side<br>
Everyday until I die<br>
Loyal to the very end <br>
Because you and I will always be bestfriends</strong><h3><br></p></div>
