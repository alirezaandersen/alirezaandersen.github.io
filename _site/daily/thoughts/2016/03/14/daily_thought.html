<h1>Daily Thought</h1>

  <h2> My daily thought!</h2>
    <p>Have we gone back as a nation? As technology has developed, we see more and more crime, violence, and hatred
  on T.V and the web than ever before. What happen to us as a "Nation United". <br><br>
The term "Nation United" is one of the most patriotic gestures of our country. When the world knows that
Americans stick together and as a Nation United are unstoppable when confronted with any disasters.
But are we really a Nation United? Today racism seems to be the front page, with people like Donald
Trump accepting endorsements from the KKK and encouraging violence from the people that endorse him and
go to his rallies.  Around the country people of poverty cannot drink the water that their city provides
them due to the lack sanitation. But they only did this in the poor neighborhoods. But in the wealthy
neighborhoods they have no issues. The value of water when something was free is now more precious the gold.<br><br>
It seems as if the hatred of race as converted over to economical status. As much as there are differences
in race and opinions, the financial gap between our countries is gone. Middle class is no longer in existence
and has gone in to different directions. The rich, and the poor., when middle class was the balance of separation
were the managers of the company reporting to the CEO while managing the floor workers. Middle class was able to
run the economy.  <br><br> What has happen now is that they have to choose sides. If middle management can’t
move up then they will become the floor workers. And this is what is happening in our society. This is why there
is only a 1% and not a 10%, 20% or 30%. The only way that we can stop this separation is to stop the greed.
The greed in which we are not willing to help others, the greed in which we demand more for less, the greed
where we must receive before we give.  For the rich who read this, whom do you have to help you if you were to
lose it all. Think about it for a bit. You’ll be surprise to find out whom you think you have. And for the poor
who read this, do you help others as well or do you only think of yourself. Besides the money that separates us from each other. Humans by nature need to change or we will always be the same.
